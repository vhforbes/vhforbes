# Hey! I'm Victor ðŸ‘‹

## Welcome to my GitHub profile!

I'm a FullStack developer with 4 years of experience. I've developerd a bunch o diferent projects with various stacks. My goal is to be a be a better develop each day, delivering high quality code meticulosly built and tought out.

In the beggining of 2020 I've entered the world of programming. Thanks to [The Odin Project](theodinproject.com/home), an open source project, I was able to fall in love with programming. Since then I've developed a ton of projects to learn it by doing!

Fast Forward to a few months latter and now I'm a developer in one of the largest companies in the world, Accenture.

I'm coding **every day**. Sometimes I like to try some different things like solidity, python and even C++. It helps me to see things from different perspectives and implement new coding concepts to my toolbelt
