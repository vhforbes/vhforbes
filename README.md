# Hey! I'm Victor ðŸ‘‹

## Welcome to my GitHub profile!

In the beggining of 2020 I've entered the world of programming. Thanks to [The Odin Project](theodinproject.com/home), an open source project, I was able to fall in love with my first programming language, **_JavaScript_**. Since then I've developed a ton of projects to learn it by doing!

Fast Forward to a few months latter and now I'm a developer in one of the largest companies in the world, Accenture.

I'm coding **every day**. Sometimes I like to try some different things like solidity, express and even C++. It helps me to see things from different perspectives and implement new coding concepts to my toolbelt

My goal is to be hired by an international company so that I can keep doing what I love in my second language.
