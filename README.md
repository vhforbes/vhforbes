<h1>Hey! I`m Victor ðŸ‘‹</h1>

  <h2>Welcome to my GitHub profile!</h2>


  <p>In the beggining of 2020 I`ve entered the world of programming. Thanks to <a target="_blank" href="theodinproject.com/home">The Odin Project</a>, an
  open source project, I was able to fall in love with my first programming language, <strong><i>JavaScript</i></strong>. Since then I`ve developed
  a ton of projects to learn it by doing! Not satisfied I`ve also enrolled on a course from <a target="_blank" href="https://www.digitalhouse.com/">Digital House</a>
  , a brazilian coding school, so that I can get a grasp of the local market requirements and good practices.
  </p>

  <p>My goal is to be hired as a junior full stack developer. It must me amazing to learn and share knowledge with
  your peers while building something big and meaningful doing it!
