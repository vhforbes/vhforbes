# Hey! I`m Victor ðŸ‘‹

## Welcome to my GitHub profile!

In the beggining of 2020 I`ve entered the world of programming. Thanks to [The Odin Project](theodinproject.com/home), an open source project, I was able to fall in love with my first programming language, **_JavaScript_**. Since then I`ve developed a ton of projects to learn it by doing! Not satisfied I`ve also enrolled on a course from [Digital House](https://www.digitalhouse.com/) , a brazilian coding school, so that I can get a grasp of the local market requirements and good practices.

My goal is to be hired as a junior full stack developer. It must me amazing to learn and share knowledge with your peers while building something big and meaningful doing it!
