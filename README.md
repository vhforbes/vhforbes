# Hey! I'm Victor ðŸ‘‹

## Welcome to my GitHub profile!

I'm a FullStack developer with 4 years of experience. I've developed a bunch of different projects with various stacks. My goal is to be a better developer each day, delivering high quality code meticulously built and thought out.

In the beginning of 2020 I entered the world of programming. Thanks to [The Odin Project](theodinproject.com/home, I was able to fall in love with programming. Since then I've always been looking for a challenge and to learn new things!
